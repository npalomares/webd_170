    <h1>Welcome to the Local jQuery User Group Website</h1>

   <h2>About this page layout:</h2>
      <p>
	The main container (parent) has 'relative' positioning so that the 'login' container can be absolutley positioned with respect to
	that main container. Otherwise, it would default to being absolutley positioned with respect to the window.
      </p>
   
     <p>
       In order for the login panel to be placed on top of the page  we need to use  absolute positioning, otherwise,
       it would move the rest of the content down as done in the FAQ assignment. Technically, absolute positioning takes that element out of
       the normal flow of the document, so that it is on top of the page. The 'ad' is also absolutely positioned to the same main container.
    </p>
