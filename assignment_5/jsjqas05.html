      <ol>
        <li>You need to re-code this file so that it works with the latest version of jQuery</li>
        <li>You need to replace the toggle() compound event method with your own code
            because the toggle() compound event method is deprecated</li>
        <li>You CANNOT add any ids or classes to the document. The HTML and CSS code must remain as it is</li>
        <li>All you will add is the jQuery Code</li>
        <li>You will use the current version of the jQuery framework</li>
        <li>You will use the following classes which are located in the embedded style sheet:</li>

          <ul>
            <li>.open</li>
            <li>.close</li>
            <li>.plus</li>
            <li>.minus</li>
          </ul>
		  
        <li>If you use the hide() and show() effect methods, you will not need to use the .open and .close classes</li>
        <li>You will also use the <strong>hover compound event method</strong> to change any CSS property (your choice)
            of the &lt;h2&gt; element when the cursor moves over and off. This will be accomplished by using the CSS() method.

      <h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
      <div>
	    <p>jQuery is a library of the JavaScript functions that you're most likely 
           to need as you develop web sites.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why is jQuery becoming so popular?</h2>
      <div>
	    <p>Three reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's free.</li>
            <li>It lets you get more done in less time.</li>
            <li>All of its functions are cross-browser compatible.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Which is harder to learn: jQuery or JavaScript?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>For most functions, jQuery is significantly easier to learn 
           and use than JavaScript. But remember that jQuery is JavaScript.
