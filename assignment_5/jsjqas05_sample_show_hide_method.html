    <h2>What is a Collie?</h2>
    <p>There are two varieties of the Collie, the rough-coated collie, being the more familiar
       [the Lassie of book, movie and TV fame], and the "smooth-coated" collie. The smooth variety
       of collie is judged by the same standard as the rough variety, except that the references
       to the quantity and distribution of the coat are not applicable to the smooth.
    </p>
   
    <h2>What is a Border Collie?</h2>
    <p>Border Collies are the fanatical black and white dogs that have been bred to herd sheep.
       They come in an assortment of sizes and colors, though they generally range from about
       30 to 60 pounds and their "typical" markings are black with a white collar, chest, head
       stripe (blaze), paws, and tail tip. These markings are only the perceived "typical" markings,
       as border collies also come in red/white, black/red/white ("tri's"), blue merle, red merle,
       mostly white, tan and black, brindle, sable, and mostly black varieties. They are quite
       commonly seen in television ads and Hollywood films (the dogs in the movie "Babe", for example,
       were border collies). They are known for their incredible herding instinct and their keen intelligence.
